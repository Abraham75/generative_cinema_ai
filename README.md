# 🎬 Generative Cinema AI
**AI-powered Visual Storytelling Automation for Filmmakers**

Generative Cinema AI is a modular Python system that leverages Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the process of visual storytelling in filmmaking. This tool assists writers, directors, and creative technologists in building cinematic scenes programmatically from screenplay text — simulating elements like framing, lighting, lens choice, camera movement, and visual texture.

## 🧠 Core Concept

Cinema is a visual language. Like any language, it has grammar, vocabulary, and structure. This project translates screenplay text into core cinematic building blocks using generative algorithms and semantic models — inspired by *Screenplectics*, narrative holism, and practical film grammar.
